> I swear, this word literally isn't in the puzzle!

We've all been there. Trying desperately to find a word in our word search.
But why waste time finding it ourselves when we can automate it? `WordSearchSolver` is a command line utility tool used to tell you the location of any word in the puzzle.

## Usage

- Download the latest jar file from [Releases](https://github.com/WillQi/WordSearchSolver/releases)
- Create a word search text file that replicates the word search, but with no spaces
- Create a word list text file that has each word you are trying to find on a different line
- `java -jar ./WordSearchSolver-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -ws pathToWordSearchFile -wl pathToWordListFile`
